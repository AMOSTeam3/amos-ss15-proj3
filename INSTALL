To build and install the project from source, the following prerequisites have
to be met:
 - JDK 8 (or compatible)
 - Maven 3
 - internet access

To build the whole project execute (in the project root folder):
$ mvn package

To run the application or the plugin, the following is needed:
 - Java 8 compatible JRE (for the eclipse plugin, eclipse needs to run with
   this JRE)
 - internet access
 - database credentials for the amos-ss15-proj3 database at osr-amos.cs.fau.de

After a successful build, the standalone jar can be found at
amos-ss15-proj3-gui/target/amos-ss15-proj3-gui-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
and the eclipse update site can be found at
amos-ss15-proj3-eclipse-updatesite/target/amos-ss15-proj3-eclipse-updatesite-1.0.0.zip

To install the plugin in eclipse, click "Help" in eclipse, then
"Install New Software...". At the upper right click "Add", then "Archive" and
navigate to the updatesite zip file. You should now be able to select the
"ReqTracker Eclipse IDE Integration" feature under Uncategorized.
